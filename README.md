1)  Implementation  of the basic 5 stage MIPS pipeline in C++  â€” IF (Instruction Fetch), ID (Instruction Decode), EX
(ALU execute), MEM (memory read/write) and WB (write back to register) both with and without bypassing
2) Implementation of the 7-9 stage pipeline , with 7 stages for ALU operations and 9 stages for
load-store operations both with and without bypassing
3) Implementation of  a branch predictor with 2-bit saturating counters and branch history registers (BHR).F
